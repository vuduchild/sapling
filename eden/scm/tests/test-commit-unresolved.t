Merging a conflict araises

  $ hg merge
  merging A
  warning: 1 conflicts while merging A! (edit, then use 'hg resolve --mark')
  1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 1 files unresolved
  use 'hg resolve' to retry unresolved file merges or 'hg goto -C .' to abandon
  [1]

Correct the conflict without marking the file as resolved

  $ echo "ABCD" > A
  $ hg commit -m "Merged"
  abort: unresolved merge state
  (use 'hg resolve' to continue or
       'hg goto --clean' to abort - WARNING: will destroy uncommitted changes)
  [255]

Mark the conflict as resolved and commit

  $ hg resolve -m A
  (no more unresolved files)
  $ hg commit -m "Merged"

Test that if a file is removed but not marked resolved, the commit still fails

  $ hg up ".^"
