// Parent ordering
// ---------------
// "Ordered" parents means that behavior will change if the order of parents
// changes.
// Whether parents are ordered varies by source control system.
// * In Mercurial, parents are stored ordered and the UI is order-dependent,
//   but are hashed unordered.
// * In Git, parents are stored and hashed ordered and the UI is also order-
//   dependent.
// These data structures will store parents in ordered form, as presented by
// Mercurial. This does hypothetically mean that a single Mercurial changeset
// can map to two Mononoke changesets -- those cases are extremely unlikely
// in practice, and if they're deliberately constructed Mononoke will probably
// end up rejecting whatever comes later.

// Other notes:
// * This uses sorted sets and maps to ensure deterministic
//   serialization.
// * Added and modified files are both part of file_changes.
// * file_changes is at the end of the struct so that a deserializer that just
//   wants to read metadata can stop early.
// * The "required" fields are only for data that is absolutely core to the
//   model. Note that Thrift does allow changing "required" to unqualified.
// * NonRootMPath, Id and DateTime fields do not have a reasonable default value, so
//   they must always be either "required" or "optional".
// * The set of keys in file_changes is path-conflict-free (pcf): no changed
//   path is a directory prefix of another path. So file_changes can never have
//   "foo" and "foo/bar" together, but "foo" and "foo1" are OK.
//   * If a directory is replaced by a file, the bonsai changeset will only
//     record the file being added. The directory being deleted is implicit.
//   * This only applies if the potential prefix is changed. Deleted files can
//     have conflicting subdirectory entries recorded for them.
//   * Corollary: The file list in Mercurial is not pcf, so the Bonsai diff is
//     computed separately.

  // "Skip past this change" support.
  //
  // The following fields allows clients to provide an accurate "skip past this
  // change" feature.  From any given range in a blame file, "skip path this
  // change" will direct the user to a *range* of lines in the same file in
  // one of the parents of the changeset that this range is blamed to (i.e.,
  // the changeset specified by `csid_index`).
  //
  // If the range originates in the first version of the file (i.e. this is
  // a root commit for the file), then these fields will not be present.
  //
  // In the simplest case, the target file is the file with the name specified
  // by `path_index` in the first parent of the changeset specified by
  // `csid_index`.
  //
  // The range of lines specified by `parent_offset` and `parent_length`
  // corresponds to the lines that were *replaced* by this range.  In the case
  // of pure insertions, `parent_length` will be 0, indicating that the new
  // lines were *inserted* before the line at `parent_offset`.
  //
  // If the file was renamed during this change, then `renamed_from_path_index`
  // will contain the index into paths of the name of the file before the rename.
  // This should be used in preference to `path_index` to find the target file.
  //
  // If the target commit was a merge commit, and the file was not present in
  // the first parent, then `parent_index` will contain the index (in the list
  // of parents in the bonsai changeset) of the first parent that does contain
  // the file.
  //
  // Thus, the algorithm for finding the destination for "skip past this change"
  // is:
  //
  //  1. Look up `csid_index` in `csids` to find the blamed changeset, and load
  //     its BonsaiChangeset.
  //  2. Find the parent at `parent_index` in the list of parents, or the first
  //     parent if `parent_index` is not present.  This is the target changeset.
  //  3. Look up the path at `renamed_from_path_index` in `paths`, or
  //     `path_index` if `renamed_from_path_index` is not present.  This is the
  //     target path.
  //  4. Load the file at the target path in the target changeset.
  //  5. Jump to the range of lines of length `parent_length` starting at
  //     `parent_offset`.  This is the range of lines that were changed by the
  //     change we are skipping over.  Note that the length might be 0,
  //     indicating an insertion.

  // The offset of this range in the file before this range was introduced that
  // was replaced by this range.  Not present for root commits.

  // Not present for ranges in root commits or commits with single parents, or
  // if the file is present in the first parent.
  //
  // Note that this is an index into the list of parents in the bonsai
  // changeset, and *not* an index into csids.
