 *

 * events, and if any locks are held that are subsequently attempted to be
 * acquired by a tracebus subscriber, this can cause a deadlock. As a general
 * rule one should try to avoid publishing to tracebus while holding any locks
 * and should be very careful when subscribers attempt to acquire locks.
 *
 * The capacity should be selected based on the expected usage in context.
 * Memory usage will be capacity * sizeof(TraceEvent) * 2, but a capacity too
 * small will block publishers. The buffer is not intended to prevent all
 * publishers from blocking, but to absorb latency in the case that subscribers
 * briefly cannot keep up.
 *
 * Ideally, capacity would be dynamically determined with algorithms similar to
 * network protocols, but a small fixed-size buffer should be sufficient.
