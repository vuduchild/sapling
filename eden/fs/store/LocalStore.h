 *
 * The LocalStore was originally only a cache.  The intent was that If an
 * object is not found in the LocalStore then it will need to be retrieved
 * from the BackingStore.  The introduction of HgProxyHashFamily renders this
 * comment a little inaccurate because we don't have a way to produce the
 * required data if the proxy hash data has been removed.  We expect things
 * to revert back to a more pure cache as we evolve our interfaces with
 * Mercurial and Mononoke.
 *
 * LocalStore is thread-safe, and can be used from multiple threads without
 * requiring the caller to perform locking around accesses to the LocalStore.
