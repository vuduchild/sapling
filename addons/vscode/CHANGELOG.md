# Changelog

## 0.1.32

### Nov 30 2023

- Added "Combine" button when selecting multiple adjacent commits in a stack, to fold them together.
  - The combine is previewed before running, so you can adjust the combined commit message.
- Added Bulk actions dropdown to the top bar to add actions that act on all commits at once
  - "rebase all draft commits" button to bulk rebase onto suggested locations
  - "clean up all" button to hide all closed commits
  - "select all" to select all draft commits, so you can take further actions in the sidebar
  - Added shortcut to select all commits
- When multiple commits are selected, allow rebasing them all from the selection sidebar
- Commit titles are no longer directly focusable, so the UI doesn't show conflicting highlights. Buttons have better Aria labels to compensate.
- Use more consistent focus colors
- Fix "Temporary Commit" appearing in commit title by default
- [#781](https://github.com/facebook/sapling/pull/781): Increase width of split column on large screens
- [#782](https://github.com/facebook/sapling/pull/782): Reduces number of PRs fetched from GitHub to improve performance

## 0.1.31

### Nov 16 2023

- Added more keyboard shortcuts and a list of shortcuts openable via Shift-?
- Add config for amend restacking. This now defaults to "Always" instead of "No Conflict"
- Allow drag & drop rebase when uncommitted changes have been optimistically removed
- Fix empty titles eating into the summary
- Add explicit ">" button next to commits to open them in the sidebar
- Remove duplicates from values in typeaheads
- Simplify "Hide" context menu item for non-stack commits
- Rewrote edited messages implementation, fixing some weird behaviors

## 0.1.30

### Nov 8 2023

- Bulk query generated files in batches of 400, so files are sorted by status before pagination in groups of 25.
  - Also warns if there are too many files to correctly sort in one batch.
- Improve handling of VS Code "modern" themes
- Update icon for warning signals to be more consistent
- Add border to icon-style buttons
- Press backspace to preview hiding a commit
- Make top bar sticky as you scroll
- Add current stack base as a suggested rebase target
- Show all changed files in the commit's files list in the sidebar
- Allow opening a diff view of a deleted file
- Allow reverting added files in the head commit

## 0.1.29

### Oct 26 2023

- Add initial support for special handling for generated files
  - Currently checks for "&#0064;generated" in the head of any files
  - Eventually this will also be configurable by path to look for commons files
  - Generated files are sorted below regular files in the list of uncommitted changes,
    and the section is collapsed by default
  - Generated files' content is hidden by default in the comparison view
  - Also supports _partially generated_ files by looking for "&#0064;partially-generated". These files are marked as generated, but not collapsed.
- Improve how obsolete commits behave with operations. If a commit is already obsolete (has a newer version from some operation, such as amending), operations will act on it specifically, instead of using the latest successor. This makes drag-and-drop rebase more predicatable when dragging onto commits which are obsolete and fixes some weird behaviors.
- Add options to goto, rebase to same public base, and rebase on top when downloading (pulling) commits
- Remember UI layout (commit info sidebar expansion/width) when reopening the page
- Smarter auto-collapsing of the commit info sidebar, such as when resizing the window
- Use a teal color for missing files to differentiate them from untracked files
- Auto-close the cwd selector when changing the cwd
- Fix weird padding on filenames in the comparison view
- Fix filenames like #backup# rendering incorrectly
- Merge commit messages when using Edit Stack
- Use your commit template when making commits with quick commit or split
- Fix minor rendering issues

## 0.1.28

- Make the uncommit button less noticeable
- Fix file names overflowing in the comparison view and split view
- Add buttons to expand/collapse all files in the comparison view
- Add a "compact" mode config option. This makes commits not wrap onto multiple lines as early, which increases the density of commits visible at the same time.
- Remove language setting, since it we don't yet have any other translations.
- Improvements to file chunk selection UX
- Fix discarding subsets of files not actually deleting them from disk

  This lets you make multiple commits out of a single large commit.
  We expect this feature to change in the next few releases.
- Now in beta: _Partial "Chunk" Selection_ of uncommitted changes.
  Click the Chunk selection button next to files to open a selection view of the file's hunks.
